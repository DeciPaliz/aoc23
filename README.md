# How to run

First make sure you have dependencies installed (by running `make deps`).

You can either compile it into an executable (by running `make`) or run it directly (by running `racket main.rkt`). Enter the day as an argument and optionally a part (either `1` or `2`, defaults to `1`).

Input files are stored in the `input/` directory, each file named like `dayXX.txt` where `XX` is the day number.
